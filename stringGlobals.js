Your goal is, to catch these tickets with the ship of NNG, so we can give the release successfully. Every ticket has a severity, and if you fail a ticket, it's severity will be added to your fail points.Be carefull MAZDA will not tolerate much. //TBD: Watch out to the duplicate tickets, which you don'T have to catch, and will only slow you down. Also be aware of the occasional \"Shake the boat!\" events! Good luck!"
